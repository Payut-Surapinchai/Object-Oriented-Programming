# Object-Oriented Programming
Instructor: David Ogle

This repository consists of all my courseworks and projects from Object Oriented Programming course in University of Colorado Denver. Through the Object Oriented Programming course, I've learned about problem-solving using object-oriented & generic programming, advanced I/O, classes, inheritance, polymorphism & virtual functions, abstract base classes, exception handling, templates, and the Standard Template Library in C++. The materials here demonstrate my abilities for problem-solving, learning new things each week, adapting to new materials, and utilizing the new concepts in various scenarios.

## Contents
*PA stands for Programming Assignment*

Files in each folder:
-`.devcontainer`: This folder defines configuration for a development container, designed to provide a consistent and pre-configured environment.

-`.github`: Github related stuffs are in this folder.

-`.vscode`: This folder stores the visual studio code's specific project settings, configurations, and other environment configurations.

-`src`: This folder stores the code for solving the problem given in that `PA`. In this folder, it will contain `.h` file(s), `.cpp` file(s), and `.exe` files.

  - `.h`: These are called "header" files. They are basically the prototype or declaration for methods or classes that I will use in `.cpp` files.
  
  - `.cpp`: There are 2 types of `.cpp` in the `src` folder. There are `main.cpp`, and `function_name or class_name.cpp`.
  
      - `function_name or class_name.cpp`: This is where I actually define the functions or classes that I declared in `.h` files.
      
      - `main.cpp`: This is where I test the functions, classes, methods, etc. I'm just testing to make sure that the things that I've made actually works.
  
  - `.exe`: These are executable files created when running the files where I test the functions, classes, and such. Usually, `main.exe` would get created because I test the `main.cpp`              file.

-`data`: Some folder will have the data folder. The data folder stores text files or any other files needed for the program.

-`.gitignore`: Tells github to ignore certain files in the folder.

-`README.md`: In each folder there will be a `README` file. These are the instructions needed to solve the problems in each `PA`.

NOTE: Each `PA`s uses an autograder to grade my answers. By committing and pushing my new code in the file, the autograder will check if I've done the process correctly or not. Hence that reason, the folders would have `.devcontainer` and `.github`. You can safely ignore these file because they are most likely for the other github repository that has an autograder. In addition, each `PA` will have "TODO/TASKS" in the `README` file which will give you guidelines and instructions to solve the problem.

- `PA1`: This assignment is about using functions and solving the given computer science and engineering problems.
- `PA2`: This programming assignment teaches about how to create a class, how to create methods in class, how to create objects, and how to use the class in `main` file.
- `PA3`: In this assignment, we dived deeper into Object-oriented programming knowledge and control structures.
- `PA4`: This programming assignment introduces the concept of function overloading, array data structure, and statistic calculations.
- `PA5`: This `PA` is about vector and array data structures as well as how to manipulate data in the data structures. In addition, this `PA` also introduces a new concept of exception           handling by using `throw` to throw an exception, and uses `try` and `catch` in the `main.cpp` file to catch the exceptions. This process is known as exception handling.
- `PA6`: This assignment talks about pointers, classes composition, and operator overloading.
- `PA7`: This programming assignment teaches about inheritance, virtual functions, and file I/O basics.
- `PA8` (optional): This `PA` was optional, but I still completed it anyways. This assignment is about inheritance relationships, pointers, and file reading.

## Instructions
To open the file and edit, download the files in `src` folder and `data` folder (if have). Then, use any IDE that supports C++ version 14 and above to run the downloaded programs. In my case, I used visual studio code. Using github codespace is also viable in this case. There are also instructions on how to compile the file in the `README.md` in each `PA`s that my instructor gave me. So, feel free to read through those instructions and use them to guide your way navigating through the `PA`s.

## About me
I'm an undergraduate in University of Colorado Denver who is majoring in Data Science, building a strong foundation on Python, C++, and R. Along with the data wrangling, data visualizations, and exploratory data analysis techniques in Python and R. I'm passionate about solving problems with data and learning new tools & techniques.
